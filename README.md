<h1>myqstudent</h1>

<strong>myqstudent</strong> is an iOS application that allows K-12 students to view grades on-the-go, given that their school district uses the Q Student Portal for grading.

<h2>No Longer Maintained</h2>
As of March 2020, this project is no longer maintained by me. As it depends on a server configured to scrape data from Q servers, please reach out to me at `me@parthsaxena.com` for details on your own implementation.
